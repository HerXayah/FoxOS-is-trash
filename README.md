👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

This is a step in the right way.
My main problem in here is though, how people were treated.
We are supposed to work together, discuss about tweaks and share them.
I dont know how much it got better in this aspect.
I created this with the premise to show how they werent punished at all _aside from jay_

However the members are still a problem.
And yes im throwing them all in one pot on purpose.

This is just unnecessary bad press for your product and makes it ultimately worse to use, not in features, but anything else.
